## Resumen 

Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition promotes lifespan in mammals, yet the mechanisms of its benefits are poorly understood. We previously reported that  classic CR protocols not  only reduce the total intake, but  also alter their natural feeding/fasting cycle of mice. Whether calories, fasting or feeding time could independently contribute to longevity remained unclear. To disentangle this, we tested a control group fed ad libiNm (AL) alongside five 30% CR protocols varying how often and when mice had access to food. We included classic CR protocols in which mice consumed their allotment as a single meal in less than 2h at the beginning of the day or night (CR-day and CR-night), or smaller meals distributed over 12h (CR-day- 12h and CR-night-12h), or evenly spread out throughout 24h (CR- spread) to eliminate any nocturnal-biased feeding pattern adopted by rodents. We found that CR alone, without fasting, extends lifespan by 10%. However, longevity benefits are boosted to 20% if any fasting period is present  and  to 35%  when feeding/fasting cycles match their natural clock-driven activity. Transcriptomic  analysis in  the  liver under AL shows that  with  aging, inflammation and metabolic pathways are up and downregulated, respectively. In the longest-lived group, night- feeding reduces such aging-related alterations, maintains robust 24h oscillations in gene expression at older ages, and improves glucose and hormonal homeostasis. We also identified genes sensitive to caloric intake, fasting, and feeding time. Our  results demonstrate that circadian interventions can promote longevity and provide a novel perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging.
